# Deep-Neural-Network-from-Scratch

This project contains my Deep Neural Network that can recognize hand written numbers from the MNIST dataset. It is completely from scratch in python, which means I didn't use any machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, or Scikit-Learn for any of the math that constitutes learning in the network.
